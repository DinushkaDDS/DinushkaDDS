### Hi there 👋

I am Dilan Dinushka!. I am currently working as a software engineer in Virtusa pvt. ltd. In this role I do various tasks related to ML/DL and Chatbots. More I work in those projects more I realize how much I dont know, so its always an adventure! 😅

I am interested in learning almost any computer science related subjects, but specially like applications of ML/DL and Distributed systems/ architectures. Simply put I like to learn about systems/algorithms and challenges which involve handling/analyzing/modelling large amount of data.
