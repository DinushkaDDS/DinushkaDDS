### Hi there 👋

I am Dilan Dinushka!. I am currently studying as a PhD student in Singapore Management University under Prof. Antoine Ledent and Prof. Hady Lauw. In this role I do various tasks related to Recommendation Systems and Representation Learning. More I work in those projects more I realize how much I dont know, so its always an adventure! 😅

I am interested in learning almost any computer science related subjects, but specially like applications of ML/DL and Information systems/ architectures. Simply put I like to learn about systems/algorithms and challenges which involve handling/analyzing/modelling large amount of data.
