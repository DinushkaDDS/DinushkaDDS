### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dilan Dinushka from Sri Lanka. I am currently working as a software engineer in Virtusa pvt. ltd. In this role I do various tasks related to ML/DL and Chatbots. More I work in those projects more I realize how much I dont know, so its always an adventure! ðŸ˜…

I am interested in learning almost any computer science related subjects, but specially like applications of ML/DL and Distributed systems/ architectures. Simply put I like to learn about systems/algorithms and challenges which involve handling/analyzing large amount of data.

The repositories in my account do not have good readme files, because I did those for learning purposes and for fun. But I promise, I will add readme files to repos I am going create in the future!

### âš¡ Facts about me:

- I have worked with many programming languages for many reasons (mainly curiosity), but master of none due to less experience. But never had any problem adapting to any of them except R and Golang.ðŸ˜’ (Those are bit weird.) 
- I like python because of easier syntaxes for quick POCs, but personally think Java and C# make more sense at least when developing web applications (which is everything in today world) though this is subject to change.
- I am not quite sure what motivates me, but I have wasted so much time in various stuff where other people might usually ignore. SO DEFINITELY NOT LAZY!
- My aim is to become a master at building great software systems and solving problems related to such systems.

## **I am always learning, so opinions change with time.**
